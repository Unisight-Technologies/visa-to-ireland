            Are you expanding your company abroad and into Ireland? Whether you plan to make the move with a talented team of existing employees or open positions to applicants around the world, many of your employees will need a visa to legally live and work in Ireland.

The process of obtaining these visas can be a bit complex depending on your employees’ country of origin and the nature of the work they’ll be doing for your company. The system in Ireland favors citizens of European countries, but it’s still possible to obtain visas for employees outside of Europe. Globalization Partners can help.

                    <h3>Types of Visas</h3>
                    <p><i>Like other countries within the European Union (EU), Ireland allows citizens of EU member nations to work without a special permit or visa. Citizens of countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland are also eligible to work in Ireland without a visa. Anyone else will require a work permit issued by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (DJEI).</i>


                    </p>
                    <p>There are several different types of permits for individuals from outside of Europe who are planning to stay in Ireland and legally work. Here are a few that may be relevant to your employees:
                  </p>

                    <h3>Requirements to Obtain an Irish Work Visa</h3>
                    <p>Ireland has strict requirements for individuals outside of the EU and EEA countries. Work visas will only be granted for high-skill work or employment where there is a shortage of skills in Ireland. An employment contract or job offer is also required before your employees can apply for a work permit</p>

                    <h4>What Is the Process for Obtaining a Work Visa in Ireland?</h4>
                    <p>
                      Your employees should apply for a visa three months before traveling to Ireland. Before applying for a work visa, they must also apply and qualify to receive immigration permission to work in Ireland.</p>

                       <p>

                       Employees will need to fill out and <a href="https://www.visas.inis.gov.ie/avats/OnlineHome.aspx">submit the visa application online.</a> They must then submit their passport and other identifying documents for processing. Details about where to send these documents will be available during the application process.</p>

<p>
  Upon approval, your employees will need to present their passport, employment contract, and other supporting documents to be allowed entry into Ireland. Finally, they must register with immigration and apply for permission to stay in Ireland.
                    </p>

                    <p>



                      Employees from countries within the EU and EEA do not need a permit to work in Ireland, but they still need to provide evidence that they have a job or sufficient funds to support themselves within three months. Your employees should also be aware that a valid multi-entry visa is necessary if they plan to leave Ireland for a short time and then return.</p>

find any suitable Irish or EU/EEA/Swiss citizen for the job and hence he is hiring a foreign national.

The Ireland Work Visa is valid for 90 days, however, the validity of one’s work visa also depends on the type of work permit. Usually, Ireland Work Permits are issued for 24 months initially and can be renewed for a maximum of 5 years. During that time, one can apply for permanent residency in Ireland. An Irish work permit can be renewed through EPOS.</p>

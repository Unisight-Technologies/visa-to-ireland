                  <p>The Australian government devised the <b>General Skilled Migration program (Skillselect)</b> in 2013 to replace the Australia skilled worker visas.</p>
                  <p>The Skillselect is designed to assess the skills of applicants under a point-based system so that immigrants with the right skills can be selected. <br></p>
                  <b>The applicants are given points under the following criteria:</b><br><br>
                  <ul style="list-style:disc">

                    <li><h5>English language proficiency:</h5>Applicants are required to take the <b>IELTS test</b>. If they score 8 bands or more, you get 20 points.<br><br></li>
                    <li><h5>Skilled employment:</h5>If you have experience in an occupation that is listed in the <b>Skilled Occupations</b> List you will get points based on the years of experience. 20 is the maximum points you can gain.<br><br></li>
                    <li><h5>Educational qualification:</h5>To get points under this category, your qualification must be related to your <b>nominated occupation</b>. 20 points is the maximum you can score if you have a doctorate while a bachelor’s or master’s degree will give you 15 points.<br><br></li>
                    <li><h5>Australian qualifications:</h5>You can get five points if you have an <b>Australian qualification</b> from an Australian educational institute.<br><br></li>
                    <li><h5>Regional study:</h5>You can gain an additional 5 points if you have <b>lived and studied in regional Australia</b>.<br><br></li>
                    <li><h5>Community language skills:</h5>You will gain another 5 points if you have <b>translator/ interpreter level skills in one of the country’s communities languages</b>.<br><br></li>
                    <li><h5>Spouse/partner skills and qualifications:</h5>If you have included your spouse/partner in the application and he/she is not an Australian resident/citizen, then their skills are eligible to be counted towards your total points. You will gain an additional five points if your <b>spouse/partner must meet the basic requirements of the Australian General Skilled Migration</b><br><br></li>

                    <li><h5>Employer Nomination Scheme:</h5>Under this scheme, a permanent work visa is given to <b>workers sponsored by their companies</b>.<br><br></li>
                    <li><h5>TSS Visa (Temporary Skill Shortage): </h5>Under this visa, individuals can work between <b>two to four years</b> depending on the employee’s requirement.

Assessing authorities are listed against your occupation in the relevant list of <a href="https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/working-in-australia/skill-occupation-list">eligible skilled occupations</a>.

Assessing authorities are listed against your occupation in the relevant list of <a href="https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/working-in-australia/skill-occupation-list">eligible skilled occupations</a>.
